I am a robotics researcher with a Ph.D. from the [Robotics Institute, University of Technology Sydney (UTS)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/robotics-institute), supervised by [Prof. Shoudong Huang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shoudong.Huang/), [A/Pro. Liang Zao](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/liang-zhao) and [Prof. Qi Hao](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/haoqi.html)(Southern University of Science and Technology). My research interests lie in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), active SLAM, deformbale SLAM and motion planning.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
